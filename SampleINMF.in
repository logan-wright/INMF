### Sample INMF Input Files
# Include the name of the scene, this will be used to name the output plots and results
name = Hawaii_baseline

# Include the filename of scene
file = H2013292233238.L1B_ISS

# Name of Run 
name = TestHawaiianImage

# Name the types of endmember you want to use to initialize the INMF, should be a comma separated list
members = Vegetation,Water,Soil,Cloud,Atmosphere

# Ending Conditions
max_i = 500 	
# max_i: Maximum number of iterations to use (If max_i is less than 10 the default value of 500 iterations will be used)
epsilon = 0	# If cost function change is less than this value iteration stops (value <= 0 will use default value)

# Constraints - Set Yes or No
ASO = No	
smooth_spectral = Yes
smooth_spatial = Yes

# The following: spectra_win, spectra_strength, spectra_gamma, spatial_win, spatial_strength, spatial_gammma 
# are only need if Smooth_Spectral or Smooth_Spatial are set to YES.
#
# spectra_win and spatial_win - 
# Set the window over which smoothing is applied. Value must be an integer or a vector of N integers (where N is the number of endmembers). Values must be odd and >= 1. 

spectral_win = [11,11,11,11,11] 
spatial_win = [5,5,5,5,11]

# spectrl

# Optional Inputs, These inputs are optional but can be used to subset the scene, improve the initial guess or set the INMF parameters
