#
# spectral_win and spatial_win:

# Default Values:
#	spectral_strength = 0.5

# spectral_gamma and spatial_gamma:
#    Are the gamma_w (y_w) and gamma_h (y_h) values in the INMF cost function.
#    These values determine how quickly the smoothing function falls off from
#    the center of the window. If no value is given default values are used.
